                <p>On ▇▇ ▇, 20▇▇, there was an noted to be an atmospheric shift in ▇ ▇▇, CA indicating a Category 3 Hurricane 
                    on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Residents were advised to brace for the storm. At ▇:▇, when the storm was predicted 
                    to hit, a <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog</b></span> instead blanketed ▇ ▇▇ in what would later be known 
                    as the <b><span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</b></span>. </p>

                <p>Beings from the <b>Otherside</b> (called <b><em>Outsiders</em></b> from this point onwards) emerged from the 
                    <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">fog</b></span>, possessing destructive tendencies as they were introduced 
                    into the city of ▇ ▇▇. The <b>>Outsiders</b> possessed remarkable physical abilities and a lack of ability to 
                    communicate with the human race. Early attempts to fight against the 
                    <b>Outsiders</b> failed, until an international organization called the <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">
                    Garden</b></span> utilized its operators to win the first front in 20▇▇. </p>
                <p>A hundred years after the <b><span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</b></span> in present day, much of the 
                    world still remains in a struggle with attempting 
                    to manage the Outsiders breaching globally. The <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">Garden</span></b>, an 
                    international organization of exorcists, has recently 
                    opened their newest branch, <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">Blue Lilac</span></b>, in the former city of 
                    Los Angeles (now renamed as <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">The Edge</span></b> due to the 
                    density of the <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog</span></b> alongside the coastal waters). The Edge 
                    is an experimental city to see if humans can 
                    return to living in the territory, focusing on <b>survival, redevelopment</b> and <b>rehabilitation.</b> </p>

                <p>New <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">Blue Lilac</span></b> <b>operatives</b> could think of themselves as 
                    <em>unlucky.</em> Blue Lilac is known among all its sister 
                    branches for being hastily built together, understaffed, overworked, and tasked with defending the most dangerous 
                    city in all of North America. Other <b>operatives</b> might think of themselves as <em>lucky.</em> while still others would 
                    consider those very people to be <em>insane,</em> though it may very well be the self-same attitude that brought them to 
                    <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">Blue Lilac</span></b> in the first place. </p>
                <p>With some joining to fulfill their idealistic aspirations, and others conscripted as parts of deals to keep their 
                    abilities in check, many would see the city as a grave, while others would see it as a gateway to freedom.</p>
