                        <div class="subtitle">at the turn of the century,</div>
                        <p>On ▇▇ ▇, 20▇▇, there was an noted to be an atmospheric shift in ▇ ▇▇, CA indicating a Category 3 Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Residents were advised to brace for the storm. At ▇:▇, when the storm was predicted to hit, a <b><u style="color: var(--accent)" title="a dense fog believed to mark the boundary between the world and the otherside">blue fog</b></u> instead blanketed ▇ ▇▇ in what would later be known as the <b><span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</b></span>. </p>
                        <p>Beings from the <b>Otherside</b> (called <b><em>Outsiders</em></b> from this point onwards) emerged from the <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">fog</b></span>, possessing destructive tendencies as they were introduced into the city of ▇ ▇▇. The <b>>Outsiders</b> possessed remarkable physical abilities and a lack of ability to communicate with the human race. Early attempts to fight against the <b>Outsiders</b> failed, until an international organization called the <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">Garden</b></span> utilized its operators to win the first front in 20▇▇. </p>
                        <p>A hundred years after the <b><span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</b></span> in present day, much of the world still remains in a struggle with attempting to manage the Outsiders breaching globally. The <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">Garden</span></b>, an international organization of exorcists, has recently opened their newest branch, <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">Blue Lilac</span></b>, in the former city of Los Angeles (now renamed as <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">The Edge</span></b> due to the density of the <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog</span></b> alongside the coastal waters). The Edge is an experimental city to see if humans can return to living in the territory, focusing on <b>survival, redevelopment</b> and <b>rehabilitation.</b> </p>
                        <p>New <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">Blue Lilac</span></b> <b>operatives</b> could think of themselves as <em>unlucky.</em> Blue Lilac is known among all its sister branches for being hastily built together, understaffed, overworked, and tasked with defending the most dangerous city in all of North America. Other <b>operatives</b> might think of themselves as <em>lucky.</em> while still others would consider those very people to be <em>insane,</em> though it may very well be the self-same attitude that brought them to <b><span style="color: var(--accent)">Blue Lilac</span></b> in the first place. </p>
                        <p>With some joining to fulfill their idealistic aspirations, and others conscripted as parts of deals to keep their abilities in check, many would see the city as a grave, while others would see it as a gateway to freedom.</p>

                    <div class="main-content summary">
                        <div class="subtitle">the state of the world</div>
                        <p>The year is currently <b>123 AC</b> <em>(After the Cataclysm)</em>. The current state of human infrastructure has returned to 80% of the functionality of the time before the <span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span>. Though a majority of the cities from the past before the <span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span> have remained the same, others have changed drastically after more than a hundred years of upheaval and strife.</p>
                        <p>Not only has the <span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog</span> remained, but <b>Otherside</b> activity runs rampant in hotspots around the globe where its reach has extended considerably. Many locations overtaken by <span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog</span> are often inhabited by <b>Outsiders</b>, with some locations more regulated than others. Most of the safer location are typically those with large branches of <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span>, an international organization who regulate <b>Otherside</b> activity. Other locations without the presence of <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> leaves them susceptible to crime and a high rate of mortality due to the general chaos the <b>Outsiders</b> bring.</p>
                        <p>Formerly, researchers believed that the <span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog</span> was directly tied to population density. Rural locations rarely had appearances of <span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog,</span> while urban locations had considerably larger amounts of <span style="color: var(--accent2)">blue fog</span> activity. However, this theory has been debunked with the increase of <span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog</span> in both rural and urban locations equally, with seemingly no rhyme nor reason as to why these hotspots appear.</p>
                        <p>While still a mystery to many, <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> aims to not only bring stability to the world, but investigate the source of the <span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog,</span> and understand what started the <span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span> in the first place.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="main-content summary">
                        <div class="subtitle">the edge</div>
                        <p>Formerly known as the city of Los Angeles, <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Edge of the Great Divide</span> (though known to most as simply <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Edge</span>), is a city undergoing rapid rehabilitation and rejuvenation efforts. The city itself had been abandoned during the early days of the <span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span>, as <span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog</span> sweeping in from the ocean destroyed most of the city. However, as the global reclamation efforts from <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> progressed and cohabitation with <b>Outsiders</b> stabilized, many had started to come back to <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Edge</span>, making efforts to restore the city to livable conditions. </p>
                        <p><span style="color: var(--accent)">The Edge</span> has made major progress compared to its early days. Despite the inherent danger of its coast straddling the <span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog</span> and the constant influx of <b>Outsiders</b>, <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Edge</span> continues to receive a wide influx of immigrants who aim to settle down in the city.</p>
                        <p>If there’s one silver lining to the chaos, it’s that rent prices have managed to fall down to affordable levels. </p>
                        <p>Due to the <span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span>, both the geography and weather have shifted drastically, rendering it unrecognizable. Few remnants of its pre-<span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span> life remains, some including the dilapidated Hollywood sign among the hills, the broken skyline of downtown, and remnants of the famed Sunset Boulevard. Though there are still sunny dry summers, <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Edge</span> receives cool autumns and even colder winters. Snow is no longer limited to the peaks of the mountains but also falls regularly during the winter, with the local fauna remaining all year round.</p>
                        <p>Members of the City Board have attempted to develop <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Edge</span> into a tourist destination. With sunny summers, snowy winters, and the salty ocean breeze all packed into one area, <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Edge</span> would make for a perfect vacation spot… if you ignore all the dangers to your life on the daily.</p>

                    <div class="main-content summary">
                        <div class="subtitle">technology</div>
                        <p>Most technology that exists in the post-<span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span> world has developed in correlation with what currently exists in the real, present timeline, up until the 2010-2020 era of technology.</p>
                        <p>While cell phones are prevalent in the post-<span style="color: var(--accent)">Cataclysm</span> world, blackout areas and spotty reception are the norm. Due to cell towers constantly undergoing repair, or unexplainable electromagnetic waves from <b>Otherside</b> activity that block out wireless reception, it is difficult to consider cellular communication reliable. When compared to how it was in the early days of the <span style="color: var(--accent)">Cataclysm</span> where most forms of long-distance communication was impossible, being able to have internet and wifi now is a blessing in itself.</p>

                    <div class="main-content summary">
                        <div class="subtitle">the blue fog</div>
                        <p>The <span style="color: var(--accent)">fog</span> remains one of the key mysteries that <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> believes is vital to understanding the <b>Otherside</b>. However, any scouting team that attempted to make its way into the fog was never heard from again, leaving <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> to put its expeditions on hold. </p>
                        <p>The <span style="color: var(--accent)">fog</span> seems to advance and recede at random, with no set pattern to its behavior. Researchers at <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> have attributed this to the constant movement and thinning of the boundary between the world and the <b>Otherside</b>, leaving the <span style="color: var(--accent)">fog</span> to act as an entrance or boundary between the two.</p>

                <!-- THE GARDEN -->
                <div class="mini-container" id="mini-tab3C">
                    <div class="main-content summary">
                        <div class="subtitle">overview</div>
                        <p>Much of the details behind when and how <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> was originally formed remains as a mystery to even the most senior of operators. Some say that the organization existed underground even before the <span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span> in preparation for the day the wall to the <b>Otherside</b> broke down. Others say <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> only managed to form itself during the <span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span> itself. No matter its origin story, <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> is currently an international organization that aims to research <span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog</span>, mitigate conflicts with the <b>Otherside</b>, and serve as a peacekeeping force within more chaotic locations.</p>
                        <p><span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden’s</span>* main headquarters is located in what was formerly known as Vatican City, formally creating their head of operations after the city had been destroyed during the <span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span>. While <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> has no official ties to Christianity, some influences from Catholic exorcism practices have integrated itself into <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> due to the proximity of the organization’s headquarters to the former central location of the Catholic faith. <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> headquarters acts as a central information hub much like a library, with the only staff there consisting of clerks and librarians who keep track of information, research, and communication. Most high-ranking officials primarily base themselves at their own respective branches, with field operatives following suit.</p>
                        <p>Main branches are commonly founded in major cities of the world, with minor branches acting as offshoots that report accordingly. Each branch is typically independently managed by their branch manager, and act according to their own philosophies. <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> has a hands-off approach when it comes to maintaining the branches, and thus each branch has slowly developed its own philosophy on the <b>Otherside</b>. In the end, so long as each branch strives to mitigate conflict between this world and the <b>Otherside</b>, <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> typically approves any and all methods to achieve the goal.</p> 
                        <p>To that end, there are certain branches that focus more on research, while others focus on crisis relief, rebuilding cities, or suppressing violent <b>Outsiders</b>.</p>
                        <div class="subtitle2">— other groups</div>
                        <p><span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> remains as the sole registered organization that specializes in <b>Otherside</b> and <b>Outsider</b> activity. Many groups formed during the early days of the <span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span> were eventually reformed into branches of <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span>. </p>
                        <p>Any remaining groups that focus on <b>Otherside</b> activity are considered unofficial as they work underground and typically operate through word of mouth. These groups are generally few and far between as their lack of resources and manpower leave them unable to work on the same scope of <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span>. Unless the members of these organizations have radical beliefs, most opt to work with <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> because of their comprehensive health care program with added benefits. </p>
                        <p>(Dental and vision is covered as well.)</p>

                        <p>The newest branch of <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span>, located in what was previously known as the city of Los Angeles, California. <span style="color: var(--accent)">Blue Lilac</span>’s main responsibilities stretch across the western and mid-western half of North America. As borders between branches still remain unfixed, <span style="color: var(--accent)">Blue Lilac</span> requires assistance from its sister branches of <span style="color: var(--accent)">The Garden</span> to function effectively.</p>
                        <p>Due to its location and recent creation, <span style="color: var(--accent)">Blue Lilac’s</span> operations and regulations are more lax compared to other branches. </p>
                        <p><span style="color: var(--accent)">The Edge</span> remains full of danger, having one of the highest casualty rates across the globe. Due to these prevailing conditions, <span style="color: var(--accent)">Blue Lilac</span> constantly finds itself understaffed. Therefore, not only does <span style="color: var(--accent)">Blue Lilac</span> accept any and all who qualify to be a part of its ranks, but all personnel are expected to partake in both field and office operations, regardless of their status as a member of the active or support services. Here, departments are a descriptor of specialty, rather than role.</p>

                            <li>This group is <b>rated 18+</b> due to the nature of potentially sensitive and dangerous situations. All members <b>must be 21+</b> by the time this group opens.
