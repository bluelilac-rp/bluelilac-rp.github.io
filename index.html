                <p>On ▇▇ ▇, 20▇▇, there was an noted to be an atmospheric shift in ▇ ▇▇, CA indicating a Category 3 Hurricane 
                    on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Residents were advised to brace for the storm. At ▇:▇, when the storm was predicted 
                    to hit, a <span style="color: var(--accent)">blue fog</span> instead blanketed ▇ ▇▇ in what would later be known 
                    as the <span style="color: var(--accent2)">Cataclysm</span>. </p>

                <p>Beings from the **Otherside** (called ***Outsiders*** from this point onwards) emerged from the **fog**, possessing 
                    destructive tendencies as they were introduced into the city of ▇ ▇▇. The **Outsiders** possessed remarkable 
                    physical abilities and an inability to communicate with the human race. Early attempts to fight against the 
                    **Outsiders** failed, until an international organization called the **Garden** utilized its operators to win the 
                    first front in 20▇▇. </p>
                <p>A hundred years after the **Cataclysm** in present day, much of the world still remains in a struggle with attempting 
                    to manage the Outsiders breaching globally. The Garden, an international organization of exorcists, has recently 
                    opened their newest branch, **Blue Lilac,** in the former city of Los Angeles (now renamed as The Edge due to the 
                    density of the **blue fog** alongside the coastal waters). The Edge is an experimental city to see if humans can 
                    return to living in the territory, focusing on **survival, redevelopment and rehabilitation. </p>

                <p>New **Blue Lilac** **operatives** could think of themselves as *unlucky.* Blue Lilac is known among all its sister 
                    branches for being hastily built together, understaffed, overworked, and tasked with defending the most dangerous 
                    city in all of North America. Other operatives might think of themselves as *lucky.* while still others would 
                    consider those very people to be *insane,* though it may very well be the self-same attitude that brought them to 
                    **Blue Lilac** in the first place. </p>
                <p>With some joining to fulfill their idealistic aspirations, and others conscripted as parts of deals to keep their 
                    abilities in check, many would see the city as a grave, while others would see it as a gateway to freedom.</p>
